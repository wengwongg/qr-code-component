## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a relatively simple challenge, but it helped me to refine my basics. I practised using the BEM CSS naming convention, and focused on writing clean code that follows the DRY principle.

I also practised estimating widths and spacing needed to follow the intended design. Lastly, I also focused on using the appropriate CSS units and clarified my understanding on how each of them work.

### Continued development

I'd like to try to use CSS grid more instead of just flexbox. I also think that this project was a bit too simple and somewhat boring, so I'd like to attempt more complex projects next time.
